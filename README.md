SafeSwap - The Trust Layer for Online Deals
Overview
SafeSwap is a universal trust layer for online transactions - a mobile-first platform that securely holds funds in escrow until both parties fulfill their obligations in a deal. It goes beyond traditional escrow by building digital trust through verified profiles, trust scoring, and comprehensive deal management.

🎯 Problem Statement
Digital transactions suffer from a fundamental trust deficit:

Freelancers deliver work but get ghosted without payment

Buyers hesitate to send money fearing they won't receive goods/services

Sellers delay shipping worried about payment disputes

This lack of trust stalls commerce and limits opportunities for honest people

💡 Solution
SafeSwap provides a universal safety net for online transactions with:

Escrow Protection: Funds locked until both parties confirm fulfillment

Trust Profiles: Verified identities with reliability scores and deal history

Savings Vault: Time-release savings for personal goals or sending to others

Dispute Resolution: Admin-mediated conflict resolution with evidence tracking

API-First Design: Easily integrable with e-commerce platforms and marketplaces
